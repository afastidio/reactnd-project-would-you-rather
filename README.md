# Would Your Rather 

The "Would You Rather?" game asks the player to select between two (usually both difficult or appealing) choices. The project allows the user to play the game, view how other people have voted, post new questions, and see the ranking of other users on a leaderboard.

## Getting Started

```

cd reactnd-project-would-you-rather

## Using the Application
To play the game, the user must select an account to sign in with. They can either use an existing account or create a new account. The program is currently set up to only allow five new accounts.

Once they sign in, they are redirected to the home page, where they can view their list of unanswered and answered questions. They need to click on a question from the list to vote or see the results of the question. 

On the New Question Tab, the user can create a new question to ask the other users. On the Leaderboard tab, they can view every user's ranking. The ranking is determined by the total of questions answered and questions asked.
